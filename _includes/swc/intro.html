  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic concepts and tools,
  including program design, version control, data management,
  and task automation.
  Participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
  <br>
  This workshop introduces learners to the programming language R,
  along with additional Data Science tools such as version control with 
  git, some Unix shell commands, and Markdown as a way to build your 
  own personal website where you can promote your work, host course
  materials, and even write a blog.
